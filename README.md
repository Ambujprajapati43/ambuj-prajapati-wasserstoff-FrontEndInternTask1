# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `Testing the Collaborative Editor`
Follow these steps to test your collaborative editor with PeerJS:

🔁 Restart Everything
Stop your React app and PeerJS server if they are already running:

bash
Copy
Edit
Ctrl + C
Restart the PeerJS server on port 9000:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx peerjs --port 9000
Start the React app:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
🧪 Test in Two Tabs
Open the first tab:

Visit: http://localhost:3000

Enter your name to join.

Copy the displayed Peer ID.

Open the second tab (or incognito window):

Visit:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:3000?connectTo=<PEER_ID>
Replace <PEER_ID> with the ID copied from the first tab.

✅ Verify the Following:
✅ No ID taken error on the console.

✅ Both users appear in the Connected Users list with names.

✅ Typing in one tab instantly updates the text in the other.
